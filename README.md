### Installing Unity

Tried to run on Linux. Unity installs, but the ecosystem around Unity and Meta Quest seems very Windows-focused. Therefore focusing on Windows to avoid any unexpected issues.

1. Install UnityHub
2. Install the latest Unity editor (not LTS). Add-ons: VisualStudio, Android SDK (all), Windows SDK
3. [Configure Unity settings](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-conf-settings/#build-settings)
3. Add any Meta quest integration packages (not yet sure if any are needed)
